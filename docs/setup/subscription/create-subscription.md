!!! tip "Free trial continues when you subscribe"

    Free trial does not necessarily end when you create a new subscription. If you just started your free trial or have some time left, you can still go ahead and subscribe for any of our plans. Your free trial will continue up until its' expiry date, at which point your subscription will take effect and your card is charged.
    
    You can check your free trial expiry date in 'My Account' > 'Subscription'.
