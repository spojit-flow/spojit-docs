        The simple chat service doesn't require any service data setup.
    
    === "3. Output Data"
 
        In this example the following output will be generated automatically by this service after it is run:

        ```json
        {
            "data": "Why did the JavaScript developer's flat method go to therapy? Because it was struggling to get to the root of its problems! (get it?)",
            "metadata": {
                "usage": {
                    "input_tokens": 61,
                    "output_tokens": 30,
                    "total_tokens": 91
                }
            }
        }
        ```
       
        The data node will have the content generated by the model while the metadata will show the model usage.
