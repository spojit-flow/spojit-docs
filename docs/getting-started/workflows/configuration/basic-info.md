!!! tip "Give your workflow a unique name"

    Basic workflow info tab allows you to edit the name, description and also the category of given workflow. You can set multiple categories to an workflow for easy classification and search. We also recommend changing the name of your workflow to something specific for easier search as you keep adding more and more workflows.

## Instructions
### 1. Log in to your account

### 2. Access 'My Automations' page

  You can access the page via the main menu by expanding  the 'Automations' menu item and selecting 'My Automations'. You should see a table listing all your workflows here.
