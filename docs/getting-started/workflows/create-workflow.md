  This will open a dialog where you can choose the project you want it to be in and clicking 'Create'

  Finally, this will open your newly created blank workflow up in the workflow designer where you can start adding and connecting services.

## Build a workflow from a template
  Workflows can be created using our pre-configured templates. To create workflow based on a template and start editing it in our workflow designer, simply find the integration template you want in the 'Workflows' Library and click the orange 'Create Workflow' button.

  After selecting the project, this will launch our workflow designer with your prebuilt integration from the template in it. To complete, simply add your own authorizations (if required) and save the workflow via the button at the top right of your screen.
