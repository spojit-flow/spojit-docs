## Build a workflow from scratch

## Build a workflow from a template
  Integrations created using our wizard can be converted to a workflow. To convert an integration to a workflow and start editing it in our workflow designer, simply find your integration on the 'Integrations' table and click the orange workflow icon.

  This will launch our workflow designer with your integration in it. To complete the conversion, simply save the workflow via the button at the top right of your screen.
