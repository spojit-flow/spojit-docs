## Introduction
The Unleashed to WooCommerce Stock Updater integration template solves the issue of overselling online and eliminates any manual labour associated with keeping your inventory levels up to date and in sync between Unleashed Software and your WooCommerce online store.

In less than 5 minutes, you will be able to reap the benefits of this integration, saving you countless hours of manual labour each and every month and leaving you more time to focus on your business.

After a simple step-by-step wizard guiding you through the initial configuration, the Spojit platform gives you the ability to choose how often you would like to check Unleashed Software for any stock level updates, starting at one minute intervals. Once set, the platform will check for any updates to stock levels in Unleashed and seamlessly update your WooCommerce online store as per the schedule.

You stay in control of the integration link and have the ability to change the schedule as you see fit. Spojit gives you detailed logs each time the integration starts, giving you insight into the integrationâ€™s performance.
