Webhooks - what are they? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook In simple terms, there are two main ways in which applications on the web communicate and share information - either by polling or using webhooks. Polling refers to one application periodically asking another if something happened. This requires a scheduler and can be inefficient as there may not be any updates in the requested period. Webhook on the other hand refers to one application sending information to another when something happens, essentially near real-time callbacks/notifications of changes. Simplified Example: Keeping inventory levels in sync between online shop and warehouse system. Polling/Schedule: Online store asks warehouse system every 10 minutes if there are any stock updates. Webhook: Warehouse system sends notification to online store every time there is an update to stock levels in the warehouse. Spojit platform allows you to generate a unique webhook URL for an integration which can then be entered into a 3 rd party system (ie. the Warehouse system from the example above) so that every time there is an update in the warehouse, the warehouse app sends info to the provided URL which in turn starts your integration.

If $start is non-negative, the returned string will start at the $start'th position in string, counting from zero. For instance, in the string 'abcdef', the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at position 2 is 'c', and so forth. If $length is given and is 0, an empty string will be returned. If $length is omitted, a string starting from $start until the end of the string will be returned. If $start is negative, the returned string will start at the $start'th character from the end of string.

Returns an array of strings, each of which is a substring of string formed by splitting it on boundaries formed by the string $delimiter . If $delimiter is an empty string (\"\"), explode will return false. If $delimiter contains a value that is not contained in string and a negative limit is used, then an empty array will be returned, otherwise an array containing $value will be returned. If $limit is set and positive, the returned array will contain a maximum of $limit elements with the last element containing the rest of string. If the $limit parameter is negative, all components except the last -$limit are returned. If $returnIndex is set, explode will return the index value of the array. explode(\"piece1 piece2 piece3\", \" \") => [\"piece1\", \"piece2\", \"piece3\"] explode(\"piece1 piece2 piece3\", \" \", 2) => [\"piece1\", \"piece2 piece3\"] explode(\"piece1 piece2 piece3\", \" \", -1) => [\"piece1\", \"piece2\"] explode(\"piece1 piece2 piece3\", \" \", 2, 0) => \"piece1\" explode(\"piece1 piece2 piece3\", \" \", 2, 1) => \"piece2 piece3\" Substring Count \u00b6 substr_count(string $value, string $search) : int Counts the number of substring occurrences in given string. Returns a number (integer) - the count of $search occurences. This function doesn't count overlapped substrings. substr_count(\"This is a test\", \"test\") => 1 substr_count(\"This is a test\", \"is\") => 2 substr_count(\"gcdgcdgcd\", \"gcdgcd\") => 1 (does not count overlapped substrings) Format String \u00b6 str_format(string $value, string $format) : string Returns a string produced according to the formatting string $format , or false on failure. The $format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (excluding %) that are copied directly to the result and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching its own parameter. A conversion specification follows this prototype: %[argnum$][flags][width][.precision]specifier. argnum is an integer followed by a dollar sign $, to specify which number argument to treat in the conversion. Flag Description - Left-justify within the given field width; Right justification is the default + Prefix positive numbers with a plus sign +; Default only negative are prefixed with a negative sign. (space) Pads the result with spaces. This is the default. 0 Only left-pads numbers with zeros. With s specifiers this can also right-pad with zeros. '(char) Pads the result with the character (char). width is an integer that says how many characters (minimum) this conversion should result in. precision - a period . followed by an integer who's meaning depends on the specifier: For e, E, f and F specifiers: this is the number of digits to be printed after the decimal point (by default, this is 6). For g and G specifiers: this is the maximum number of significant digits to be printed. For s specifier: it acts as a cutoff point, setting a maximum character limit to the string. Specifier Description % A literal percent character. No argument is required. b The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a binary number. c The argument is treated as an integer and presented as the character with that ASCII. d The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a (signed) decimal number. e The argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2). The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after the decimal point E Like the e specifier but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2). f The argument is treated as a float and presented as a floating-point number (locale aware). F The argument is treated as a float and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware). g General format. Let P equal the precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero. Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X: If P > X \u2265 \u22124, the conversion is with style f and precision P \u2212 (X + 1). Otherwise, the conversion is with style e and precision P \u2212 1. G Like the g specifier but uses E and f. o The argument is treated as an integer and presented as an octal number. s The argument is treated and presented as a string. u The argument is treated as an integer and presented as an unsigned decimal number. x The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters). X The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with uppercase letters).

If $length is omitted, each chunk will be a single character long. split(\"string\") => [\"s\", \"t\", \"r\", \"i\", \"n\", \"g\"] split(\"string\", 2) => [\"st\", \"ri\", \"ng\"] Regex Match \u00b6 regex_match(string $value, string $pattern, int $matchIndex) : string Performs a regular expression search of $value by $pattern specified. Returns found match by the $matchIndex . $pattern is the pattern to search for in given string. Pattern Description [abc] A single character: a, b, or c [^abc] Any single character but a, b, or c [a-z] Any single character in the range a-z [a-zA-Z] Any single character in the range a-z or A-Z ^ Start of line $ End of line \\A Start of string \\z End of string .

This service can write a CSV file from source data (API/Webhook etc) which could be used that to create a file on a FTP or send the file as an email attachment.

Creating a CSV \u00b6 When the write configuration is selected the service will write a CSV file from mapped data and configuration options. Option Description Default Required Method Select \"write\" to write a CSV file. - TRUE Headers The CSV headers are not required as a file will generate without them with all the data; however, if they are specified only matching columns will be generated.

Each field within the array can be a column (depending on how headers are setup) and each index of the array consists of a row in the CSV. For this example we are going to switch to the ARRAY schema and add id and job as fields to that ARRAY: Given the following source data from another service: { \"data\" : [ { \"id_number\" : \"1\" , \"job_name\" : \"Scuba Diver\" }, { \"id_number\" : \"2\" , \"job_name\" : \"Plumber\" } ] } Next we can map the data array on the array in the field mapping with the id_number and job_name on id and job respectively as fields within the array: 3. Output Data In this example the following output will be generated automatically by this service after it is run: { \"data\" : \"ID,Job\\n1,Scuba Diver\\n2,Plumber\\n\" , \"metadata\" : {} } This output data can be used to create a CSV file like this: Reading a CSV \u00b6 When the read configuration is selected the service will read the raw data from a CSV file to create an array of output data.

The Document OCR (Optical Character Recognition) service allows you to read text and tables in documents (such as PDFs) which could be used to make an API request or create an Excel or CSV file. Important The Document OCR service will sometimes pick up outliers and other noise/graphics as text or have difficulty reading some text depending on the font. Changing the sections and implementing functions can help to eliminate this issue. Always test with multiple documents prior to implementing in a production environment to ensure that the proper functions have been used to get the required result.

If you don't have an account you can checkout out the pricing and register here . If you already have an account you can login here . This service can facilitate the parallel processing of a collection of items. The service itself can consist of two separate services within the application: fork and join . A scenario where this could be useful is if you receive a list of products from a webhook and need to retrieve the SKU of each product. We could use the iterator to go through the collection of product and retreive the SKU information before continuing. In order to get this scenario to work you would add an iterator fork on to the canvas. The fork would be split the collection and process each route in parallel. A service would be set up on the route for the task to request the SKU for each product. We would then add an iterator join before continuing with the workflow. The scenario could look like this on the canvas (where Start is the incoming webhook and End is the continuation of the workflow): graph LR A[Start] --> B{FORK} B -->|Get SKU info| C[HTTP GET Request] C --> F F{JOIN} --> G[End] Configuration \u00b6 When added to the canvas the fork only requires the following to work: Option Description Default Required Iteration Array The array to be iterated over. - TRUE There is no configuration for the join .

If you don't have an account you can checkout out the pricing and register here . If you already have an account you can login here . This service can facilitate the parallel processing of multiple routes. The service itself can consist of two separate services within the application: fork and join . A scenario where this could be useful is if you receive an online order from a webhook and you need to send the order and tracking information to a dropshipper. In the webhook itself there is no customer or product information which is needed and a tracking number has not been generated. We could use the parallel gateway to retreive the product and customer information and send the request to get a new tracking number at the same time before sending the information to the dropshipper. In order to get this scenario to work you would add a parallel gateway fork and three HTTP request services on to the canvas. The fork would be joined to prior services and would have three routes (one to each HTTP service). The services would be set up for the relevant task (getting product information, getting customer information, creating a tracking number). We would then add a parallel gateway join and add a route from each service to it before continuing with the workflow. The scenario could look like this on the canvas (where Start is the incoming webhook and End is the sending of the data to the dropshipper): graph LR A[Start] --> B{FORK} B -->|Get product info| C[HTTP GET Request] B -->|Get customer info| D[HTTP GET Request] B -->|Create tracking number| E[HTTP POST Request] C --> F D --> F E --> F F{JOIN} --> G[End] Configuration \u00b6 When added to the canvas the fork parallel gateway service will be automatic and not require any further configuration. Tip The parallel gateway does not specifically need a join in order to work and will finish without any issues. The join makes a synchronous workflow outside of parallel processing by waiting until all parallel routes are complete before continuing (similar to async/await in JS). Omitting the join will lead to an asynchronous workflow where routes could continue in any order. Example configuration and mapping 1. Configuration There is no required configuration for this service. 2. Service data setup This service doesn't require any service data setup. 3.

If you don't have an account you can checkout out the pricing and register here . If you already have an account you can login here . This service can write or read a XLSX (Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet) file from source data (API/Webhook etc) which could be used that to create a file on a FTP or send the file as an email attachment. Creating a Microsoft Excel file \u00b6 The following configuration options can be used to create the raw data for a XLSX file from mapped data. Option Description Default Required Method Select \"write\" to create a XLSX file - TRUE Headers The XLSX headers are not required as a file will generate without them with all the data; however, if they are specified only matching columns will be generated. If added the Header Key and Header Value is required for each. - FALSE Header Key The field in the data that the column corresponds to. - TRUE Header Value The name of the column header in the XLSX file. - TRUE Important Mapped service data must be contained with an ARRAY where the fields match the desired header columns. The parser does not generate the file itself rather the raw data that can be used by other services to generate a file (i.e SFTP/Email). Example configuration and mapping 1. Configuration The following example shows you how to configure the XLSX service to create a two column XLSX file from an array of data. The configuration is set up to create two headers for the columns. 2. Service data setup After the configuration is setup we can then create a schema for the output XLSX. Each field within the array can be a column (depending on how headers are setup) and each index of the array consists of a row in the XLSX. For this example we are going to switch to the ARRAY schema and add id and job as fields to that ARRAY: Given the following source data from another service: { \"data\" : [ { \"id_number\" : \"1\" , \"job_name\" : \"Scuba Diver\" }, { \"id_number\" : \"2\" , \"job_name\" : \"Plumber\" } ] } Next we can map the data array on the array in the field mapping with the id_number and job_name on id and job respectively as fields within the array: 3.

LITE subscribers do not have access to workflows. Introduction to Workflows \u00b6 What is a workflow \u00b6 A workflow is a sequence of steps, where each step is responsible for a unique function. The collection of steps coupled with data flow controls and connections between steps forms a workflow which represents a process. Process can be as simple as 'send a notification via SMS' or as complex as a home loan application. Workflow Designer \u00b6 The Spojit platform offers a visual designer where you can model, test, manage, and automate your processes. Our workflow designer allows you to add any number of services (steps) onto a canvas and connect them together, creating a logical sequence of steps. As a user, you have complete access to data at each step (both input and output data of each service). A process is modeled through a combination of services using the visual workflow designer. You add one or more services onto the canvas, and configure and connect those in order to model a process. Workflow designer allows you to schedule your workflows to run automatically at your specified times. Services \u00b6 Each service is an independent mini application facilitating a unique function (ie. send SMS, or fetch data from a server). Depending on complexity, a service may require configuration and/or authorization. For example a mailing service will require you to configure the email recipients, or the subject of the email. A http service usually requires you to add some kind of authorization. A service has an input data and output data, both of which you can control directly from the service configuration. Services - Data Mapping \u00b6 A service input data can be mapped and transformed using a built-in mapper service which allows you to define your data structure (schema), map fields from other services, and also apply functions to transform the data. Services - Output Data \u00b6 The Spojit platform generates service output schema for you automatically. You can however filter and change the data outputed by each service directly from the service 'OUTPUT' configuration. Data Flow Controls \u00b6 Data flow controls are special services which allow you to inject special logic into the workflow and which control the flow of the data. An example flow control would be a filter or an iterator. Filter allows you to conditionally allow or deny futher processing and iterator flow control allows you to work with arrays (data multiples; ie. many sales orders retrieved from a server via API). Workflow vs Integration \u00b6 All integrations are essentially ready-made workflows with a well defined set of configuration options which you have access to and which you can modify. As an end user, you can not go beyond these configuration options. Workflow takes it a step further and gives you complete access to the integration itself in our visual designer, where you can modify existing steps, add new ones, and change configuration and flow of data however you like. Workflows give you a complete access to process automation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"user-guide/workflow/introduction/#introduction-to-workflows","text":"","title":"Introduction to Workflows"},{"location":"user-guide/workflow/introduction/#what-is-a-workflow","text":"A workflow is a sequence of steps, where each step is responsible for a unique function.
