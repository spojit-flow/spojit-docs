Webhooks - what are they? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook In simple terms, there are two main ways in which applications on the web communicate and share information - either by polling or using webhooks. Polling refers to one application periodically asking another if something happened. This requires a scheduler and can be inefficient as there may not be any updates in the requested period. Webhook on the other hand refers to one application sending information to another when something happens, essentially near real-time callbacks/notifications of changes. Simplified Example: Keeping inventory levels in sync between online shop and warehouse system. Polling/Schedule: Online store asks warehouse system every 10 minutes if there are any stock updates. Webhook: Warehouse system sends notification to online store every time there is an update to stock levels in the warehouse. Spojit platform allows you to generate a unique webhook URL for an integration which can then be entered into a 3 rd party system (ie. the Warehouse system from the example above) so that every time there is an update in the warehouse, the warehouse app sends info to the provided URL which in turn starts your integration.
