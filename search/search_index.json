Webhooks - what are they? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook In simple terms, there are two main ways in which applications on the web communicate and share information - either by polling or using webhooks. Polling refers to one application periodically asking another if something happened. This requires a scheduler and can be inefficient as there may not be any updates in the requested period. Webhook on the other hand refers to one application sending information to another when something happens, essentially near real-time callbacks/notifications of changes. Simplified Example: Keeping inventory levels in sync between online shop and warehouse system. Polling/Schedule: Online store asks warehouse system every 10 minutes if there are any stock updates. Webhook: Warehouse system sends notification to online store every time there is an update to stock levels in the warehouse. Spojit platform allows you to generate a unique webhook URL for an integration which can then be entered into a 3 rd party system (ie. the Warehouse system from the example above) so that every time there is an update in the warehouse, the warehouse app sends info to the provided URL which in turn starts your integration.

For instance, in the string 'abcdef', the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at position 2 is 'c', and so forth. If $length is given and is 0, an empty string will be returned.

If $delimiter contains a value that is not contained in string and a negative limit is used, then an empty array will be returned, otherwise an array containing $value will be returned.

The $format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (excluding %) that are copied directly to the result and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching its own parameter. A conversion specification follows this prototype: %[argnum$][flags][width][.precision]specifier. argnum is an integer followed by a dollar sign $, to specify which number argument to treat in the conversion. Flag Description - Left-justify within the given field width; Right justification is the default + Prefix positive numbers with a plus sign +; Default only negative are prefixed with a negative sign. (space) Pads the result with spaces. This is the default. 0 Only left-pads numbers with zeros. With s specifiers this can also right-pad with zeros. '(char) Pads the result with the character (char). width is an integer that says how many characters (minimum) this conversion should result in. precision - a period . followed by an integer who's meaning depends on the specifier: For e, E, f and F specifiers: this is the number of digits to be printed after the decimal point (by default, this is 6). For g and G specifiers: this is the maximum number of significant digits to be printed. For s specifier: it acts as a cutoff point, setting a maximum character limit to the string. Specifier Description % A literal percent character. No argument is required. b The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a binary number. c The argument is treated as an integer and presented as the character with that ASCII. d The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a (signed) decimal number. e The argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2). The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after the decimal point E Like the e specifier but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2). f The argument is treated as a float and presented as a floating-point number (locale aware). F The argument is treated as a float and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware). g General format. Let P equal the precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero. Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X: If P > X \u2265 \u22124, the conversion is with style f and precision P \u2212 (X + 1). Otherwise, the conversion is with style e and precision P \u2212 1. G Like the g specifier but uses E and f. o The argument is treated as an integer and presented as an octal number. s The argument is treated and presented as a string. u The argument is treated as an integer and presented as an unsigned decimal number. x The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters). X The argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with uppercase letters). Type Specifier string s integer d, u, c, o, x, X, b double g, G, e, E, f, F str_format(\"5\", \"There are %s monkeys in the tree.\") => \"There are 5 monkeys in the tree.\" str_format(\"123\", \"%'.9d\") => \"......123\" str_format(\"123\", \"%'.09d') => \"000000123\" str_format(\"123.1\", \"%01.2f\") => \"123.10\" str_format(\"362525200\", \"%.3e\") => \"3.625e+8\" Split \u00b6 split(string $value, [int $length)] : array Splits a string $value into chunks and returns all chunks as an array (converts string to an array). $length is the maximum length of each chunk after split.

LITE subscribers do not have access to workflows. Introduction to Workflows \u00b6 What is a workflow \u00b6 A workflow is a sequence of steps, where each step is responsible for a unique function. The collection of steps coupled with data flow controls and connections between steps forms a workflow which represents a process. Process can be as simple as 'send a notification via SMS' or as complex as a home loan application. Workflow Designer \u00b6 The Spojit platform offers a visual designer where you can model, test, manage, and automate your processes. Our workflow designer allows you to add any number of services (steps) onto a canvas and connect them together, creating a logical sequence of steps. As a user, you have complete access to data at each step (both input and output data of each service). A process is modeled through a combination of services using the visual workflow designer. You add one or more services onto the canvas, and configure and connect those in order to model a process. Workflow designer allows you to schedule your workflows to run automatically at your specified times. Services \u00b6 Each service is an independent mini application facilitating a unique function (ie. send SMS, or fetch data from a server). Depending on complexity, a service may require configuration and/or authorization. For example a mailing service will require you to configure the email recipients, or the subject of the email. A http service usually requires you to add some kind of authorization. A service has an input data and output data, both of which you can control directly from the service configuration. Services - Data Mapping \u00b6 A service input data can be mapped and transformed using a built-in mapper service which allows you to define your data structure (schema), map fields from other services, and also apply functions to transform the data. Services - Output Data \u00b6 The Spojit platform generates service output schema for you automatically. You can however filter and change the data outputed by each service directly from the service 'OUTPUT' configuration. Data Flow Controls \u00b6 Data flow controls are special services which allow you to inject special logic into the workflow and which control the flow of the data. An example flow control would be a filter or an iterator. Filter allows you to conditionally allow or deny futher processing and iterator flow control allows you to work with arrays (data multiples; ie. many sales orders retrieved from a server via API). Workflow vs Integration \u00b6 All integrations are essentially ready-made workflows with a well defined set of configuration options which you have access to and which you can modify. As an end user, you can not go beyond these configuration options. Workflow takes it a step further and gives you complete access to the integration itself in our visual designer, where you can modify existing steps, add new ones, and change configuration and flow of data however you like. Workflows give you a complete access to process automation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"user-guide/workflow/introduction/#introduction-to-workflows","text":"","title":"Introduction to Workflows"},{"location":"user-guide/workflow/introduction/#what-is-a-workflow","text":"A workflow is a sequence of steps, where each step is responsible for a unique function.
